# Detecting_ripeness_of_fruits_using_machine_learning

In this project technology used tensorflow library, CNN, data preprocessing
Detection of Fruit Ripeness â€” CNN, SVM
Developed a Fruit Ripeness Detection system utilizing CNN neural networks, specializing in banana
classification. Successfully trained the model on an extensive image dataset of bananas, yielding superior
accuracy compared to SVM
